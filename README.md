Secure File Sharing System
This project is a secure file sharing system built using Python and the Flask framework. The primary focus of this application is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of files by implementing robust security measures. Users can securely upload and download files, with all data protected through encryption.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
Secure File Upload and Download: Users can upload files through a simple web interface. The system ensures that files are handled securely throughout the process.

Encryption: All uploaded files are encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) before being stored. This means even if the storage is compromised, the files remain unreadable.

Secure Transfer: Files are served using secure protocols, ensuring data is encrypted during transfer from the server to the user's browser.

Authentication (Optional): This system can be extended with user authentication to control who can upload and access files.

Clean and Simple UI: A user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS makes the application easy to use.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the backend logic.

Flask: A lightweight and powerful web framework used to build the application.

pycryptodome: A comprehensive Python library providing cryptographic recipes and primitives for secure encryption (e.g., AES).

HTML/CSS: For the front-end user interface.
